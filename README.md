# Building Security in the Cloud with AWS Write-Up

## *‚ÄúSecurity in the cloud isn‚Äôt magic ‚Äî it‚Äôs methodical.‚Äù*

I completed a 4-phase project called **Cloud Security Builder** using AWS. Each phase simulated real-world security challenges ranging from data protection to VPC-level control, encryption, monitoring, and automated compliance. Here‚Äôs how I secured the cloud, step by step.

## Phase 1: Locking Down S3 Buckets
Objective: Secure data in S3 and monitor access
### Key Steps:
- Configured a private **data-bucket** with fine-grained **IAM policies**
- Enabled **versioning** and **object-level logging**
- Activated **S3 Inventory** to track metadata
- Used **Athena** to query S3 access logs and validate authorization/denial
**Result:** Unauthorized users (like *mary*) were blocked, while valid access (e.g., *paulo*) succeeded and was logged. Versioning worked across uploads. Athena confirmed secure access and visibility.

## Phase 2: Network Security with VPC & Firewall
Objective: Create layered defenses in AWS networking
### Key Steps:
- Reviewed VPC flow and created **VPC Flow Logs**
- Secured ports with **Security Groups** and **Network ACLs**
- Created and deployed **AWS Network Firewall** with route tables
- Set up **CloudWatch** for logging dropped packets
- Created **stateful rule groups** to allow ports 22, 80, 443, and ICMP, while denying 8080
**Result:** Confirmed secure HTTP/SSH access and saw blocked port 8080 traffic logged in CloudWatch ‚Äî proving effective firewall policies.

## Phase 3: End-to-End Encryption with AWS KMS
Objective: Protect data at rest using AWS KMS
### Key Steps:
- Created **MyKMSKey** with **auto key rotation**
- Updated **key policies** to authorize specific IAM users (e.g., *sofia*)
- Encrypted S3 uploads with **SSE-KMS**
- Encrypted EC2 root volume during instance creation
- Performed **envelope encryption** using AWS CLI + OpenSSL on a live instance
**Result:** Only authorized users could upload/read encrypted content. EC2 instance volumes and custom data were secured using proper key scopes and least-privilege policies.

## Phase 4: Real-Time Monitoring and Compliance
Objective: Establish audit, alert, and remediation pipelines
### Key Steps:
- Used **CloudTrail** to track S3 API activity
- Installed **CloudWatch Agent** on EC2 to capture SSH login attempts
- Created **CloudWatch Alarms** for successful SSH access
- Deployed **AWS Config** with `s3-bucket-logging-enabled` rule
- Used **Systems Manager** to automate remediation for non-compliant buckets
**Result:** A fully observable system that logs events, detects misconfigurations, and enforces compliance automatically.

## üîÑ Challenges Faced

|  Problem |  Fix |
|-----------|--------|
| IAM permission conflicts | Revised trust & access policies |
| KMS access denial | Adjusted principal permissions in the key policy |
| CloudWatch log filters not triggering | Fine-tuned log pattern matching |
| Config compliance issues | Used Systems Manager for auto-remediation |

## Key Takeaways

- **Defense in Depth** works best with **visibility + control**
- KMS, when combined with IAM policies, can enforce powerful encryption workflows
- Logging without alarms = noise; automated response is key
- S3 versioning + Athena = cloud-native forensics

This project made me appreciate how intricate yet modular AWS security can be. With each layer, whether it‚Äôs IAM, firewall rules, encryption, or monitoring ‚Äî we get closer to a **zero-trust, resilient cloud environment**.
Feel free to clone this structure, fork the approach, or ping me if you‚Äôre building something similar!
